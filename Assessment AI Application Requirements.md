# Assessment AI Application Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered assessment management web application that enables teachers to upload assessment briefs and marking rubrics, automatically mark student work, generate feedback, and provide analytics for improving teaching materials. The system will also include an admin interface with customization capabilities.

## User Roles

### Teacher Role
1. **Assessment Management**

3. **Analytics and Recommendations**
   - Analysis of all markings
   - Recommendations for enhancing learning materials based on student performance
   - Insights into common student mistakes or misunderstandings

### Admin Role
1. **Website Customization**
   - Drag-and-drop template interface for website customization
   - No coding required for design changes
   - Similar to WordPress page builder functionality
   - Section management and layout control

   - Admin dashboard with customization tools
   - Analytics visualization
   - Notification system

### Backend
1. **AI Algorithm**
   - Natural Language Processing for understanding assessment briefs and rubrics
   - Text analysis for marking student work
   - URL processing and evaluation
   - Feedback generation based on marking results

2. **Database**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Storage for assessment briefs, rubrics, and student work
   - Categories and module organization
   - Analytics data storage

3. **Security**
   - Secure user authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Data encryption
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
   - Secure file upload handling

### Additional Features
1. **Reporting**
   - Export marking results and feedback
   - Generate reports on student performance
   - Analytics visualization

2. **Integration**
   - Potential API for integration with other educational systems
   - Batch processing capabilities

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Fast response times for AI marking
   - Efficient handling of file uploads
   - Scalability for multiple users

2. **Usability**
   - Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
   - Clear feedback and error messages
   - Comprehensive help documentation

3. **Reliability**
   - Consistent marking results
   - Backup and recovery mechanisms
   - Error handling and logging

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Technology Stack**
   - Flask for backend (Python)
   - React for frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)
   - MySQL for database
   - NLP libraries for AI marking (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or Transformers)

2. **Development Approach**
   - Modular architecture for extensibility
   - Test-driven development
   - Security-first approach
   - Iterative development with continuous testing

# Security Validation Report

## Authentication Security
- ✅ Password hashing implemented with secure algorithm (Werkzeug's scrypt)
- ✅ Password hash column sized appropriately (512 characters)
- ✅ User sessions managed securely with Flask-Login
- ✅ Login form protected against brute force attacks
- ✅ Session timeout implemented for security

## CSRF Protection
- ✅ Flask-WTF CSRF protection enabled globally
- ✅ CSRF tokens included in all forms
- ✅ CSRF token validation on all POST requests

## Access Control
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented (admin vs teacher roles)
- ✅ Route protection based on user roles
- ✅ Proper authorization checks before data access
- ✅ Secure redirects after authentication

## Data Security
- ✅ Input validation on all form submissions
- ✅ Parameterized queries used to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ File upload validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure handling of sensitive data

## API Security
- ✅ API endpoints protected with authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
- ✅ Input validation on all API requests
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements
1. Implement two-factor authentication for admin accounts
2. Add IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
3. Implement regular security audits and penetration testing
4. Consider adding HTTPS enforcement in production
5. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
